Task2 - Create network

- In the portal create a new Virtual Network in the resource group you created in the previous task
  - Give it a name (vnet-webapp) and set the address space to be 10.0.0.0/16
  - Change the default subnet name to sn-agw and check the address range it 10.0.0.0/24 
  - add another subnet called sn-app with the address range 10.0.1.0/24
  - add another subnet called sn-data with the address range 10.0.2.0/24
  - Go to the Security tab in the wizard and select "enable" on BastionHost, give it a name bastion-webapp, and the address space 10.0.50.0/24.

- In the portal create a new network security group in your existing resource group, with the name nsg-datasn.
  - once created go into the NSG and create a new inbound security rule to allow TCP 1433 from the app subnet
  
- Ensure the NSG's are assigned to their respective subnets
